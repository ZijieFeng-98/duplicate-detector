# 🔧 PDF Upload & Processing Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED  
**Commits:** `46d861f`, `2ec9fa9`

---

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Your app showed:**
```json
{
  "Runtime": "0.00s",
  "Total Pairs": 0,
  "Panels": 0,     ← NO IMAGES EXTRACTED!
  "Pages": 0,      ← NO PDF PROCESSING!
  "Device": "CPU"
}
```

**This means:** The PDF file never made it to the detector. It failed at **Stage 0** (before any duplicate detection even started).

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

### **Cause 1: File Upload Not Completing**
- PDF uploaded to Streamlit's temp directory
- But backend script couldn't find the file
- Path issues between upload and processing

### **Cause 2: Silent Failures**
- Backend script exited immediately (0.00s)
- No error messages
- No validation of PDF file

### **Cause 3: Tile-First Mode Issue**
- Experimental tile-first pipeline has different error handling
- May fail silently if PDF isn't properly loaded

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: File Validation in Streamlit (streamlit_app.py)**

**Added before running backend:**
```python
# Validate PDF file exists
pdf_path = Path(st.session_state.pdf_path)
if not pdf_path.exists():
    st.error(f"❌ PDF file not found: {pdf_path}")
    st.error("This may be a file upload or permissions issue")
    st.info("💡 Try re-uploading your PDF")
    st.stop()

# Use absolute paths
cmd = [
    sys.executable, str(detector_script),
    "--pdf", str(pdf_path.absolute()),  # Absolute path!
    "--output", str(Path(config['output_dir']).absolute()),
    ...
]

# Debug logging
st.info(f"📄 Processing: {pdf_path.name} ({size:.1f}MB)")
print(f"DEBUG: PDF path: {pdf_path.absolute()}")
print(f"DEBUG: PDF exists: {pdf_path.exists()}")
print(f"DEBUG: PDF readable: {os.access(pdf_path, os.R_OK)}")
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Catch upload failures before processing
- ✅ Show clear error message to user
- ✅ Use absolute paths (more reliable)
- ✅ Log file info for debugging

### **Fix 2: PDF Validation in Backend (ai_pdf_panel_duplicate_check_AUTO.py)**

**Added at Stage 0:**
```python
# Validate PDF file
if not PDF_PATH.exists():
    print(f"❌ ERROR: PDF file not found!")
    print(f"   Path: {PDF_PATH}")
    print(f"   Absolute: {PDF_PATH.absolute()}")
    print("\n💡 This usually means:")
    print("   1. The file wasn't uploaded correctly")
    print("   2. The path is wrong")
    print("   3. File permissions issue")
    sys.exit(1)

# Check if readable
with open(PDF_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    header = f.read(8)
    if not header.startswith(b'%PDF'):
        print(f"❌ ERROR: File is not a valid PDF!")
        print(f"   Header: {header}")
        sys.exit(1)

print(f"✓ PDF file validated: {PDF_PATH.name} ({size:.1f}MB)")

# Extract pages
pages = pdf_to_pages(PDF_PATH, OUT_DIR, DPI)
if not pages:
    print("❌ ERROR: No pages extracted from PDF")
    print("\n💡 This usually means:")
    print("   1. PDF is password-protected")
    print("   2. PDF is corrupted")
    print("   3. PyMuPDF failed to process the file")
    return
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Explicit error messages (not silent failure)
- ✅ Validate PDF signature
- ✅ Check file permissions
- ✅ Helpful diagnostics for common issues

## 🎯 What You Should See Now

### **After Successful Upload:**
```
📤 Upload Page:
✅ your-file.pdf (10.5MB)
📄 Ready to analyze
   • File: your-file.pdf
   • Size: 10.5 MB
   • Pages: ~50 (estimated)
```

### **During Processing:**
```
▶️ Run Page:
📄 Processing: your-file.pdf (10.5MB)

[Stage 0] Preprocessing...
✓ PDF file validated: your-file.pdf (10.5MB)

[1/7] Converting PDF to PNGs at 150 DPI...
Converting pages: 100%|████████| 50/50
✓ Saved 50 pages

[2/7] Auto-detecting panels...
Detecting panels: 100%|████████| 50/50
✓ Extracted 221 panels total
```

### **If Upload Fails:**
```
❌ PDF file not found: /tmp/...pdf
This may be a file upload or permissions issue on Streamlit Cloud
💡 Try re-uploading your PDF

[← Back to Upload]
```

### **If PDF is Invalid:**
```
❌ ERROR: File is not a valid PDF!
   Header: b'\x00\x00\x00...'
   Expected: %PDF-...

💡 This usually means:
   1. File is corrupted
   2. Wrong file type (not a PDF)
   3. File was truncated during upload
```

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Re-Upload Your PDF**

1. Go to **"📤 Upload"** page
2. Drag & drop your PDF (or click to browse)
3. **Wait for confirmation:**
   ```
   ✅ your-file.pdf (X.X MB)
   📄 Ready to analyze
   ```
4. **If you don't see this → upload failed!** Try again.

---

### **Step 2: Use Standard Pipeline First**

Don't use experimental Tile-First mode until we confirm the PDF works.

1. Go to **"⚙️ Configure"** page
2. Select **"🎯 Balanced"** preset
3. Under **"🔬 Micro-Tiles Mode"**, select: **"Force OFF"**
4. Under **"Detection Strategy"**, keep: **"Universal"**
5. Click **"Start Analysis →"**

---

### **Step 3: Watch the Logs**

On the **"▶️ Run"** page:

1. Expand **"📋 Detailed Logs"**
2. **Look for:**
   ```
   ✓ PDF file validated: your-file.pdf (10.5MB)
   Converting pages: 100%|████████| 50/50
   ✓ Extracted 221 panels total
   ```

3. **If you see errors:**
   - **"PDF file not found"** → Re-upload
   - **"Not a valid PDF"** → File is corrupted
   - **"No pages extracted"** → PDF is password-protected or corrupted
   - **"No panels detected"** → PDF has no extractable images

---

### **Step 4: Check Results**

After ~60-120 seconds, you should see:

```json
{
  "Runtime": "82.5s",     ✅ Real processing time
  "Total Pairs": 25,      ✅ Found duplicates
  "Panels": 221,          ✅ Images extracted
  "Pages": 50,            ✅ PDF processed
  "Device": "CPU"
}
```

**If you still see 0/0/0 → your PDF has an issue!**

---

## 🔍 Debugging: Common PDF Issues

### **Issue 1: Password-Protected PDF**

**Symptoms:**
```
✓ PDF file validated
Converting pages: 0%|          | 0/0
❌ No pages extracted
```

**Solution:**
- Open PDF in Adobe Acrobat
- Remove password/encryption
- Re-save and re-upload

---

### **Issue 2: Scanned Images (Not Text PDF)**

**Symptoms:**
```
✓ PDF file validated
✓ Saved 50 pages
Detecting panels: 100%|██| 50/50
❌ No panels detected!
```

**Explanation:** Panel detection works on vector graphics or embedded images, not scanned pages.

**Solution:**
- Use OCR to extract images first
- Or use a different PDF with embedded figures

---

### **Issue 3: Corrupted PDF**

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ ERROR: File is not a valid PDF!
   Header: b'\x00\x00...'
```

**Solution:**
- Re-export PDF from source application
- Try "Print to PDF" to recreate it
- Check original file isn't corrupted

---

### **Issue 4: File Too Large**

**Symptoms:**
- Upload never completes
- Browser shows loading spinner forever

**Solution:**
- Check file size (limit: 200MB)
- Compress PDF if needed
- Split into smaller PDFs

---

## 📊 Expected vs Actual (Now)

### **BEFORE (What You Saw):**
```json
{
  "Runtime": "0.00s",    ← Instant failure
  "Total Pairs": 0,
  "Panels": 0,           ← Nothing extracted!
  "Pages": 0             ← PDF not processed!
}
```

### **AFTER (What You Should See):**
```json
{
  "Runtime": "60-120s",  ← Real processing
  "Total Pairs": 1-50,   ← Found duplicates
  "Panels": 50-300,      ← Images extracted
  "Pages": 10-50         ← PDF processed
}
```

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After re-uploading and running with Standard Pipeline, you should see:

- [ ] **Upload confirmation:** "✅ Ready to analyze"
- [ ] **File validation:** "✓ PDF file validated"
- [ ] **Page extraction:** "✓ Saved X pages"
- [ ] **Panel detection:** "✓ Extracted X panels total"
- [ ] **Processing time:** >30 seconds (not 0.00s)
- [ ] **Results:** Pairs found (or "No duplicates" if none exist)

**If any step fails → see the debugging section above!**

## 🎓 Why Standard Pipeline First?

**Tile-First Mode (Force ON):**
- ✅ More thorough (finds sub-panel duplicates)
- ✅ Better for confocal grids
- ⚠️ Experimental (less error handling)
- ⚠️ Memory-intensive (can OOM on Cloud)
- ⚠️ Slower (~2-3x processing time)

**Standard Pipeline (Force OFF):**
- ✅ Proven and stable
- ✅ Fast (~60-120s for 50 pages)
- ✅ Memory-efficient
- ✅ Better error messages
- ⚠️ May miss sub-panel duplicates

**Strategy:** Use Standard first to confirm PDF works, then try Tile-First if needed.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait 3 minutes** for Streamlit Cloud to redeploy
2. **Re-upload your PDF** (make sure you see ✅)
3. **Use "Balanced" preset** + **"Force OFF"** tiles
4. **Run and check logs** for errors
5. **Report back** what you see!

---

## 📝 What to Send Me If It Still Fails

**If you still see 0 pages / 0 panels:**

1. **Screenshot of Upload page** (after upload completes)
2. **Screenshot of Run logs** (expand "📋 Detailed Logs")
3. **PDF filename and size**
4. **Settings used** (preset, tile mode)

Then I can diagnose the exact issue!

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED**  
**Confidence:** 🟢 **HIGH** - Now shows clear error messages  
**Next:** Wait for Streamlit Cloud redeploy (~3 min) → Re-upload PDF → Try Standard Pipeline
