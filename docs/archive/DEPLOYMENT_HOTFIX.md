# 🔧 Deployment Hotfix - ModuleNotFoundError

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED  
**Commit:** `8f89a3e`

---

## 🚨 Issue

Streamlit Cloud deployment was failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'open_clip_wrapper'
```

**Location:** `ai_pdf_panel_duplicate_check_AUTO.py:4675`

**Root Cause:** The code was attempting to import from a non-existent module `open_clip_wrapper`:
```python
from open_clip_wrapper import load_clip as load_clip_wrapper
```

This module was referenced in documentation but was never created or committed to the repository.

---

## ✅ Solution

**Replaced the incorrect import with existing functionality:**

### Before (Broken):
```python
# Load CLIP model
from open_clip_wrapper import load_clip as load_clip_wrapper
clip_model, preprocess = load_clip_wrapper(device=DEVICE)
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Load CLIP model (use existing function)
clip_obj = load_clip()
clip_model = clip_obj.model
preprocess = clip_obj.preprocess
```

**Why this works:**
- The `load_clip()` function is already defined in the same file (line 3377)
- It returns a `CLIPModel` object with `.model`, `.preprocess`, and `.device` attributes
- No additional module is needed

---

## 📋 Verification

✅ **Linter Status:** Clean (only pre-existing `psutil` warnings)  
✅ **Git Status:** Committed and pushed to `main`  
✅ **GitHub:** Updated (commit `8f89a3e`)  
✅ **Streamlit Cloud:** Auto-deploying now

---

## 🎯 Impact

- **Severity:** Critical (deployment blocker)
- **Scope:** Tile-first pipeline only
- **Main pipeline:** Unaffected
- **UI:** No changes needed

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

During the integration of the tile-first pipeline, a local import was added that referenced a wrapper module. This was likely:
1. Part of a local development environment
2. Accidentally referenced without being created
3. Not caught because the tile-first path is optional (flag-controlled)

The main pipeline uses `load_clip()` directly and was never affected.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for Streamlit Cloud auto-deployment
2. **Check deployment status** at your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
3. **Test the tile-first mode** with `--tile-first` flag to verify the fix
4. **Monitor for any additional errors** in the deployment logs

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

- ✅ Always verify all imports exist before committing
- ✅ Test optional code paths (flag-controlled features)
- ✅ Keep module dependencies minimal and explicit
- ✅ Use existing functions instead of creating wrappers when possible

---

## 🎊 Status: RESOLVED

The deployment blocker has been fixed. Your app should now deploy successfully to Streamlit Cloud!

**Auto-deployment triggered:** The push to `main` will automatically trigger a new Streamlit Cloud build. Check your dashboard for status updates.
